This is a simple solid-js demo that shows how to hook up components and signals to the loading and template inferencing steps of ad-llama. [./components](./components) has ShowInfer and Loading, which are one way of displaying UI for loading and inferencing. The main [./app.tsx](./app.tsx) is an MVU app which adds to the view on each update so we can see our history of templates and inferences.
